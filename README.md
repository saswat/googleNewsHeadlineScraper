This is a script to scrape google news headlines containing a certain keyword. 

Running the notebook after changing keyword of interest will give you a csv with columns containing publication month, publication year, publication name, and headline.

Change the count variable to however many results are needed. URL ending in 20 shows results 10 through 20, for example....so put 200 if there are 200 total results or however many headlines are desired
